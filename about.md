Hi! My name is Maya. I am *definitely a real, living humanperson* and this is my website. I like to describe myself as an **imperfectionist**.

Currently, I am a [Ford-Mozilla open web fellow](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/08/21/mozilla-announces-25-new-fellows-in-openness-science-and-tech-policy/) working with [Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice](https://www.astraeafoundation.org). Previously, I worked at [The Engine Room](https://theengineroom.org) as the resident "Techno Queen". I like helping people solve both small and LARGE problems. I use my l33t haXor skillz to support social change projects and nice people. I also think humor is important and am always looking for venues where laughing is desperately needed.

I live in Berlin where the other security haX0rs have migrated. I spend most of my time eating Vietnamese food and perfecting my fake German English accent.
