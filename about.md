Hi! I am Maya Richman. I am *definitely a real, living humanperson* and this is my website. I like to describe myself as an **imperfectionist**.

Currently, my official work title is "Techno Queen". I like helping people solve both small and LARGE problems. I dabble in web development, electronic music and systems administration. I use my l33t haXor skillz to support social change projects and nice people. I also think humor is important and am always looking for venues where laughing is desperately needed.

I live in Berlin where the other security haX0rs have migrated. I spend most of my time eating Vietnamese food and perfecting my fake German English accent.
