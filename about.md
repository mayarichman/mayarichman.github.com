Maya Richman is an cis white queer californian living in berlin, searching eternally for someone
to make silly music with. When sheâ€™s not singing karaoke, she can be found [facilitating
workshops on well-being and technology](/about) for social justice and human rights organisations around
the world. She has sang and performed experimental electro-acoustic sets in in Montreal and
Berlin, hosted feminist community radio program [XXFiles on local Montreal station CKUT.fm](https://old.studioxx.org/en/xxfiles/xxfiles/atelier-nonstrument-mode-emploi) and
led workshops on holistic security and collective care at Mozilla Festival, Internet
Freedom Festival and Radical Networks. A former [Mozilla Fellow](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/08/21/mozilla-announces-25-new-fellows-in-openness-science-and-tech-policy/), she worked
with Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice to support internal sustainability processes, and
supported research on surveillance capitalism and resilience of LBQT activists in the US. She
dabbles in zine-making, watercolor painting and is currently in training to be a trauma-informed somatic practitioner using the [Pantarei Approach](https://pantareiapproach.com/). Maya loves to amp up a crowd,
whether to get them working together to tackle climate justice or to sing their heart out on
stage.
