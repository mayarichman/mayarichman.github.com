      <h3>recollections of a night</h3>
      <p>in the most silent place i've heard<br>within a wooden lion's den<br>the walls seemed to rumble with the stomachs of the house<br>both hungry and fed up<br></span>when i couldn't see my own hands<br> but i could feel yours<br>we crawled and slipped down the stairs<br>i was afraid<br><br></br>because the imagination can run amuck<br>in the discomfort of the dark<br>to see the possibilities of everything when all is removed from sight<br><br>earlier,<br> sitting at the dining room table, draped in shadows,<br>my brain felt stuffed with cotton as i attempted to match your essay's volume word for word in my<br>diary<br><br>somehow this emptiness gave rise to a blinding day<br>shape, <i>form</i>, <strike>line</strike>, <strong>tone</strong> overcrowded me<br>and<br> i<br> was<br> a<br>new<br>york<br>city<br>high<br>rise<br><br></br>occupied by my own distractions<br>i tell my tenants to take out the trash<br>go for a walk<br>enjoy the day<br>but they don't move an ___________inch<br>they can't hear me over the city's long, sorrowful bellows<br>  the helicopters above me just hover<br>they are ideas I once owned<br>but are now drones to flowering sky scrapers in spring,<br>and dribbling more-water-than-sand castles at high tide<br></p>
