    <p>My name is Maya and I enjoy doing many things:</p><ul>
        <li>conversing about topics that excite me,</li>
        <li>puns</li>
        <li>and being vague.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These days I hang around Montreal making <a href='{{base}}/music'>music</a>, researching and reading about hackers, radical feminism, and surveillance. I also have been building an open source jekyll-powered large blogging platform for <a href='youngist.org'>{young}ist.</a></p>
        <p>I also cohost a radio program on CKUT 90.3 FM in Montreal called <a href='http://www.studioxx.org/en/xxfiles'>XXFiles</a> where we talk about all things related to women in the D-I-G-I-T-A-L world.</p>
        <p>In 2012, I began my journey into the world of web design, working as an intern at <a href="mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>.Take a gander at some of the projects I have worked on <a href="https://github.com/developmentseed/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>If you enjoy looking at CV's or think I might be the right fit for some job, here's a link to my <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1p0e041a3x2I2M0v431Z/MayaSayreRichman_CV_.pdf'>CV.</a></p>
        <p>The site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on Github Pages.</p>
