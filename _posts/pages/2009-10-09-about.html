    <p>My name is Maya and I enjoy doing many things:</p><ul>
        <li>conversing about topics that excite me,</li>
        <li>puns</li>
        <li>and being vague.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most recently, I have begun my journey into the world of web design, working as an intern at <a href="mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>.Take a gander at some of the projects I have worked on <a href="https://github.com/developmentseed/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on Github Pages.</p>
