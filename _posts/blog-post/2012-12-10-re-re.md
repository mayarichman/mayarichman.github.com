<h5>The Cult of Cut-and-Paste</h5>
<p>Recently I have endeavored to learn about remix culture for Gabriella Coleman's course, Hacker Culture and Politics. I couldn't think of a better way to accomplish this than by engaging with the culture directly, discovering for myself the joys and frustrations of making. I have compiled thoughts, quotes, video clips and digital art from this process at <a href='http://mayarichman.github.com/remix-culture'>mayarichman.github.com/remix-culture</a>. Feel free to peruse!</p><p><img src='https://dl.dropbox.com/u/24683141/Remix/i-fergot.jpg' width=550 /></p>
