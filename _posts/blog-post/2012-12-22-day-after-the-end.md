<h5>Presents for Friends</h5>
<p>Made a tripartite abstract art piece for my grandmother this holiday season. The white paper is thin Japanese calligraphy paper and the colored is from an Origami pack. Orange, pink and purple are underused colors for Christmas, which is such a shame. The aura of Los Angeles falls more closely with a vibrant, toxic, and sometimes artifical, sunset spectrum rather than a traditional red/green binary.</p><p><img src='http://f.cl.ly/items/2H3s2b322G1l3y311d2X/Image%202012.12.23%2010:55:08%20PM.png' width=550 /></p>
