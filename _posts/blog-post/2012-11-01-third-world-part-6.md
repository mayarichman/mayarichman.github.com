<h5>LA LIVIN</h5>
<p>	It is fitting that the process of searching for information regarding third world solidarity has led me along a similar path as those who find themselves realizing their own racial/ethnic positioning. When I began my search for third world solidarity movements, specifically those in LA, I found more articles regarding racial tension and conflict than solidarity movement. I was positioned by the sources that appeared first, those more accessible and popular, to believe that the solidarity movements were not as prolific in LA as I had hoped. It occurred to me that this process of wading through the external interpretations of race and racial/ethnic hierarchy, allowed me to understand the foundations upon which these positions are articulated. This immersion and reevaluation, and near constant confrontation with the expected race relations, is similar to the experiences of Laura Pulido who grew up in San Pedro in a tight-knit Mexican family when she began to realize how she was different from those around her.</p><p>In her book, <font style='font-style:italic;'><a href='http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520245204'>Black, Brown, Yellow, and Left: Radical Activism in Los Angeles</a></font>, Laura acknowledges the separation that she felt between ethnic group, with Asians somewhere in between Black and Mexicans but not quite “on the same level as white either”(17).  Although she expresses a deeper understanding of Blacks as a similarly “devalued racial/ethnic group”, and that her racial position was somehow tied to theirs, she still expresses the initial fearfulness that she was in the same position as Blacks(17).<img src='http://www.secfac.wisc.edu/images/p_HilldalePulido.jpg' height=450;></br>
Her story is precisely the perspective I have searched for. She stands out in the literature as someone who was “convinced” to believe in the ethnic/racial ranking but through abounding curiosity and genuine sincerity was able to look past them to see the context of a “larger racial landscape”, one that brought about the creation of “political space for the development of a Third World Left.”(19).</p>
