<h5>BOND.</h5><p>BOND is an extremely intense, adrenaline pumping, action packed, fright filled take on the classic kids game “hide n seek”. The objective is for the runners to get from Point A to Point B under the time limit, without being tagged.</p><p>Heres the twist... the chasers are driving cars.</p><p>It gets intense. As a runner, you've got to cover about a mile of ground. As you will see on the maps, were playing in mostly residential neighborhoods. Everything is fair game except backyards and hopping fences. Its only fun if the cars have a chance to spot you.</p>
