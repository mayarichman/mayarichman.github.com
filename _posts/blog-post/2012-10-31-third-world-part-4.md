<h5>Contradiction Is A Ruling Principle. No, It's Not!</h5>
<p>The following quotes come from Huey Newton during an interview with William Buckley. I found them incredibly thoughtful and eloquent. More to come...</p>
<p>Huey: "I agree with you the only revolution that is worth fighting is a humane revolution "<br><br>William: "Also, one that succeeds. I feel if King George had caught George Washington, he would have had the right to hang him.<br><br>Huey: "According to the law. But revolutions always, in some ways, contradict some laws, that's why it's called a revolution."</p>

<p>Huey: "I think we can judge revolution on the basis of how much in fact, or objectively, <font style='font-weight:600;font-size:20px;'>people are given a fair, are dealt with in a fair way, and are given more freedom</font>. I think one of my principles is that <font style='font-weight:600;font-size:20px;'>contradicton is a ruling principle of the universe</font>  and everything in phenomena, whether it is the physical world or the biological world or the social world, has it's internal contradiction that gives motion to things that internal strain and most of the time that <font style='font-weight:600;font-size:20px;'>we homosapians</font> don't realize that no matter what sort of conditions we establish, now matter what government we establish at this point, there also will be that internal contradiction that will have to be resolved and resolved ina rational and just way and of course that leads us somewhat very vauge on how to deal with it, and many times we claim actions are revolutionary when they are not, so I have to appreciate your answer and I would agree with that part of it."
