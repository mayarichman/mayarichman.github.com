<h5>Minus Pastors.</h5>
<p>Today I had fun with rasters in <a href='http://www.qgis.org/'>QGIS</a> and <a href='mapbox.com/tilemill/'>TileMill</a>.</p><img src='{{base}}/img/overlay-raster.png' width=550><p>This shows post-fire vegetation condition but I have duplicated it several times so it is practically indistinguishable.</p><img src='{{base}}/img/rasterblur.png' width=550><p>This is a blurred version of the raster. I find it very calming. Just a reminder for those who want to make sweet raster maps in TileMill, check out [this blog post](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/reprojecting-geotiff/) from Mapbox.</p>
