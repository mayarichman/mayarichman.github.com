<p>
By the time, he realized the rain was falling slower,<br>
it was already snow<br>
or already winter.<br>
</p>
<p>It was then that he noticed that the space he was occupying had been home,<br>
previously,<br>
to the kind of family that would revel in this transition,<br>
from rain, to snow, to ice, and grass.</p>
<p>Even when he lay on his bed to rest,<br>
space expanded and enveloped him<br>
into a nothingness that was neither apparent,<br>
nor consequential to anyone other than himself.<br></p>
<p>With arms of lead and frail craneâ€™s neck,<br>
he was as destructive as a wrecking ball,<br>
with one millionth its weight.</p>
