<p>He, Who wished his brittle teeth would last till spring</p>

<p>He, Who surpassed the fog in transparency</p>

<p>was,</p>

<p>for and instant</p>

<p>a sickly ember from an ancient firebreath,<br>
that hung on words like whiskey,</p>

<p>and, although he felt a hollowness within his eyelids,
he chose to wear his glasses<br>
until the lenses turned to Sea Glass<br>
And a heavy dust fossilized them,<br>
casting them eternally as an artifact.</p>

<p>Until they were quietly disposed of one day,<br>
or lay buried, partly skeletal, amid rust and literature.</p>
