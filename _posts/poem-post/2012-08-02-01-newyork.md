<div class='italic'>in the most silent place i've heard</div><p>within a wooden lion's den<p>the walls seemed to rumble with the stomachs of the house<p>both hungry and fed up<p>when i couldn't see my own hands<p> but i could feel yours<p>we crawled and slipped down the stairs<p>i was afraid</p><div class='italic'>because the imagination can run amuck</div><p>in the discomfort of the dark<p>to see the possibilities of everything when all is removed from sight</p><p>earlier,</p><div class='italic'>sitting at the dining room table,</div><p> draped in shadows,</p><p>my pain felt stuffed with cotton as i attempted to match your essay's volume word for word in my</p><p>diary somehow this emptiness gave rise to a blinding day<p>shape, <i>form</i>, <strike>line</strike>, <strong>tone</strong> overcrowded me</p><p>and</p><p>i</p><p>was</p><p>a</p><p>new</p><p>york</p><p>city</p><p>high</p><p>rise</p><p>occupied by my own distractions</p><p>i tell my tenants to take out the trash</p><p>go for a walk</p><p>enjoy the day</p><p>but they don't move an ___________inch</p><p>they can't hear me over the city's long, sorrowful bellows</p><p>the helicopters above me just hover</p><p>they are ideas I once owned</p><p>but are now drones to flowering sky scrapers in spring,</p><p>and dribbling more-water-than-sand castles at high tide</p>
</div>
