<p>You are wringing my cords dry</p>
<p>they are made of tired cotton,</p><p>harsh</p>
<p>but they are familiar.</p>
<p>later,</p>
<p>when you play that string on wood and</p>
<p>I hear the them ringing,</p>
<p>reverberating in the cavities between my adolescent bones</p>
<p>and holy organs,</p>
<p>I would remember how fragile I could be</p>
<p>my body is a million puzzle pieces</p>
<p>“sent from heaven”, my ma would tell me,</p>
<p>if I believed in ghosts I would say</p>
<p>doing laundry is the closest I can get to the supernatural</p>
<p>to see them dance on the line like overworked ballerinas</p>
<p>flailing in the breeze</p>
