<p>the walking man<br>
in the corridor between the museum and the rest<br>
- pacing<br>
his lumbering legs<br>
camo wind breaker<br>
- - just pacing<br>
2 steps forward<br>
then once more<br>
piruoette <br>
and repeat</p>


<p>where is he wandering?<br>
a glance at the peonies<br>
rot peach and silk<br>
then he looks past me<br>
so far<br>
he sees his own back<br>
- - - just pacing</p>
<p>I am watching him with intense nonchalance<br>
as he feeds the squirrels<br>
from a chalkly bag of peanuts<br>
then our eyes meet<br>
ashamed<br>
his otherness and my gaze confront each other<br>
the squirrel nearby, crunches intently<br>
he was witness<br>
but has no reason to tell<br>
I look at my poem<br>
scratched onto my Easter yellow post-it note<br>
and now it's history<p>
