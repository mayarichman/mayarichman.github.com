the walking man
in the corridor between the museum and the rest
- pacing
his lumbering legs
camo wind breaker
- - just pacing
2 steps forward
then once more
piruoette 
and repeat


where is he wandering?
a glance at the peonies
rot peach and silk
then he looks past me
so far 
he sees his own back
- - - just pacing

I am watching him with intense nonchalance
as he feeds the squirrels
from a chalkly bag of peanuts
then our eyes meet
ashamed
his otherness and my gaze confront each other
the squirrel nearby, crunches intently
he was witness
but has no reason to tell
I look at my poem
scratched onto my Easter yellow post-it note
and now it's history
