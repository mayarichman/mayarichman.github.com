<p>As if it wasn’t enough already, her coming here. Her! Here!</p>
<p>When the day was a cold as my lover’s feet, we decided to sit together.
Our limbs were planks of splintered wood and dead bolts,
rotting more with each coming tide.
But, I was forewarned, “Things fall apart; the center cannot hold”
Nearby, a shark gnawed upon a leg of driftwood,
amidst an eerily tranquil sea, the silence of the moribund.</p>
<p>She mentioned how mangled our nest was, like an overused eraser,
when the fog rolled in on a rough tongue,
lapping at the horizon.</p>
<p>“If we were simply celestial bodies,” I told her, “then making love would be like two clouds passing each
another”</p>
<p>Her sullen eyes, reflecting green algae, slowly met my gaze.</p>
<p>“and I could fall into you, despite the swell of storm, and remain unharmed.”</p>
<p>There, following a shuffle of sodden leather and plank,
I saw our reflection magnified in a drop of rain,
and became sure of our discorporate form.</p>
<p>At that moment, neither of us thought of the braided rope that hung below the
deck, heavy with foam and barnacle.</p>
