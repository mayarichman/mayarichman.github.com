A while back I promised to make a newsletter. This did not happen. Here is a meme that incapsulates my feeling on the subject.

I posted some screenshots of libreoffice notes on twitter. Possibly the most inaccessible format of communicating. I'm still learning I guess.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">late night ramblings on performance culture <a href="https://t.co/ymUo0yCwvy">pic.twitter.com/ymUo0yCwvy</a></p>&mdash; maya (eat the) richman (@mayarichman) <a href="https://twitter.com/mayarichman/status/1396570653088755725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Now that I got my personal site up and running again, I guess it's time to make good on my promise. Perhaps I don't need a newsletter or shouldn't make one if I can't even write a single post on my personal website.

This is the beginning of a likely short lived attempt at writing something publicly so as to quell my deep-seated fears that I am never really doing anything.
